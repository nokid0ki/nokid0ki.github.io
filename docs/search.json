    "text": "We will investigate the average rental prices of HDB flats and its trends. The scope of this analysis involves rental prices between 2021 to 2023, covering 1 to 5 room flats. The data set used is publicly available here! üòÜ\n\nPrices against type of flat üõè\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIntuitively, the mean prices for 1-room flats would be the cheapest, and executive flats being the most expensive. However, the increment in price plateaus as the size of the HDB flat increases. As seen, the price increase between a 4-room and a 5-room flat is 4%, whereas the price increase between a 1-room and 2-room flat is 26%.\nIf space is a concern, and you‚Äôre deciding between a 4-room and a 5-room, it‚Äôs more worthwhile to rent a 5-room flat.\n\n\n\nA heat map of mean rental prices in each planning areaüìç\nHover over the area to view the planning area, and click upon it to view the mean rental price! (Edit: WIP in calculating mean per HDB type)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n Data set for the polygon‚Äôs coordinates can be found here!\n\n\nDistribution of different HDB types across planning areas üìä\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nGenerally, 4-room flats are the most abundant type of HDB rental. Below, we will be able to see the distribution of HDB rentals across regions and individual planning areas.\n\nCentral\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEast\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNorth-East\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWest\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTrend in rental prices over the 3 years üìà\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDespite the limitation of the data set having only 3 years of data, it is evident that there is a consistent increasing trend across all planning areas. Further, it is observed that the increase in rental prices are relatively unanimous as well.\n\n\nPlaceholder title for further analysis ü´ß\nPlaceholder text"
